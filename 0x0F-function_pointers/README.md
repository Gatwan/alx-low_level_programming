6. You are allowed to use \_putchar

8. All your header files should be include guarded

| 3-main.c | This file should contain your main function only. |
| 3-op\_functions.c | This file should contain the 5 given functions (not more) |
| 3-get\_op\_func.c | This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You’re not allowed to declare any other function. |
