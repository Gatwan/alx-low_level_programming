# C - Search Algorithms

# Requirements
1. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
2. Your code should use the Betty style.
3. Use main.c files to test your functions
4. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h

# Files
|File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 0-linear.c | Searches for a value in an array of integers using the linear search algorithm |
| 1-binary.c | Searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm |
| 2-O | time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n |
| 3-O | space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n |
| 4-O | time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n |
| 5-O | space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n |
| 6-O | space complexity of this function / algorithm |
