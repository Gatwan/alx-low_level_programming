## General
How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Requirements
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
3. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
4. You are not allowed to use global variables
5. The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
6. You are allowed to use \_putchar
7. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function \_putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
8. All your header files should be include guarded
